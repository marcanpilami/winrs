WinRS for Python
#####################

Introduction
================

This is a simple command line utility to remotely connect to a Windows server (or any server with a WSMan server)
from any other os (Linux, Windows, ...) through the WSMan web service API (the API on which Remote Powershell is built).

It allows to run arbitratry *non-interactive* commands on the remote system.

In its current incarnation, it has fairly big security limitations:

* Only supports HTTP connection, not HTTPS (often not an issue in LAN environments)
* Only supports BASIC HTTP authentication. It will therefore be compulsory to relax a security option on the remote server.
  (the association of the two points creates a security risk, where the password is sent unencrypted over the network)
  
Further evolutions will see the implementation of HTTPS, which will moot the security risk.
A second, more long term evolution will be the use of certificates for authentication instead of basic HTTP login/password.


Remote server configuration
===============================

In an elevated (admin) PowerShell session :

# Check if remoting is activated (service must be started)
Get-Service WinRM

# If not running, enable remoting
Enable-PSRemoting

# To check the ports used for remote admin (default is 5985)
ls -recurse wsman:\localhost\Listener\*

# Allow Basic auth without encryption (security risk!)
set-item  WSMan:\localhost\Service\AllowUnencrypted $true
set-item  WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\Basic $true

Run the command line
========================

shell> python shell.py
winrs> connect login password hostname_or_ip [port]
winrs> C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command ls
[results go here]
winrs> exit

Please note in the above exemple that we have given the full powershell path. Indeed, the remoting system used 
is actually only made for launching processes - it is not a shell environment. So often, commands will include a shell
(cmd.exe or powershell).

Finaly, use of interactive commands will not really work.
